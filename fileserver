-- File Sharing

Using Samba, I was able to create a file server on my main Pi where I am able to host files that I can either transfer to other devices or even store on there as well.

As I am the only user on the Pi, I did not have to worry about access controls, and user management to a degree but I am slowly learning by adding 'fake' users that let me learn  Linux permissions.

I was able to learn how the file system works on Raspberry Pi's OS, and how sharing works over the network. I was able to learn how to adjust the protocol version, set a minimum version, to enable encryption to protect my data in transit even though my network is 'safe'.

Instructions: 


Open a termimal/command prompt
ssh username@pi-hostname
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install samba -y

-- Add Samba User 
sudo smbpasswd -a 'existing-user's username'

sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf/backup 
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf 

server min protocol = SMB3
server max protocol = SMB3_11
smb encrypt = required

[Name of Share]
comment = Comment 
path = /home/user/foldertobeshared
valid users = existinguser
read only = no 
create mask = 0700
directory mask = 0700
hide files = /lost+found/

sudo systemctl reload smbd
