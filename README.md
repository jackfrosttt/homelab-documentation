Documentation about my Home Lab

-- Overview of my Homework Network 
For my personal devices on my home network, I have a laptop, multiple Raspberry Pi 4Bs, Pi Zeros, a Dell Optiplex desktop and a 3D printer now.
I just use a standard, /24 addressing scheme with about anywhere from 30-45 reservations taken at a time.
